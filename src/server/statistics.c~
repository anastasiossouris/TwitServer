 * by one by sayersListener(). 
 * The only members that cannot be changed by the other threads and *must* be updated every some time unit
 * are stats_averageTwitsIncomingRate and stats_averageTwitsOutcomingRate. The time unit is obtained
 * from config.h (STATS_UPDATE_NSEC). The statisticsUpdater() function updates those two fields every
